# Sports News + Image Gen Agent

This is my first Agent! It can get the latest news from ESPN (for NFL, men's and women's tennis). If you ask nicely, it can even generate an image using the headline. 

Example:
> Show me today's top NFL news headline in text and create an image to accompany it.

```
Final answer: "Commanders add John Madden's grandson Jesse to coaching staff"
```

Clearly, I'm not using the best image generation model out there. But this was a fun start!
